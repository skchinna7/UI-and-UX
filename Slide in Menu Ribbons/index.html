  <h1>Pier Pressure</h1>
<p>Steve Holt! There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Really? Did nothing cancel? I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Steve Holt! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.</p>
<h2>Good Grief!</h2>
<p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. I hear the jury's still out on science. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've opened a door here that I regret.</li>
<li>Steve Holt!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Afternoon delight</h3>
<p>Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
<h4>Good Grief!</h4>
<p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Across from where? We just call it a sausage. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. Guy's a pro. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.</p>

<li>I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</li>
<li>I'm half machine. I'm a monster.</li>

<h5>Mr. F</h5>
<p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.</p>
